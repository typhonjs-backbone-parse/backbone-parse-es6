Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling.

backbone-parse-es6 is an extension to [backbone-es6](https://github.com/typhonjs-backbone/backbone-es6) which is a fork of [Backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) converting and modularizing it into idiomatic ES6. The impetus for this fork is to experiment with modernizing and making Backbone easier to modify in a granular fashion. In particular the Parse JS SDK (http://www.parse.com) previously also was a fork of Backbone, but with the 1.6+ SDK release the Backbone API was unceremoniously removed. backbone-es6 provides the base for backbone-parse-es6  which provides a solution for Backbone dependent Parse users. 

Another reason for backbone-parse-es6 is supporting end to end documentation via ESDoc for ES6 frameworks and apps built on top of backbone-parse-es6. An integrated build and testing NPM module [typhonjs-npm-build-test](https://github.com/typhonjs-node-npm-scripts/typhonjs-npm-build-test) including several plugins for ESDoc along with a complete integrated set of Gulp tasks, [typhonjs-core-gulptasks](https://github.com/typhonjs-node-gulp/typhonjs-core-gulptasks) provide documentation generation across multiple modules / source roots via JSPM along with ESLint and several JSPM & NPM tasks.

backbone-parse-es6 uses [JSPM](http://www.jspm.io) / [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) for dependency management and bundling distributions. For an example of using JSPM / SystemJS directly with backbone-parse-es6 including typhonjs-core-gulptasks support please see these demo repos:
- https://github.com/typhonjs-demos/backbone-parse-es6-todos
- https://github.com/typhonjs-demos/backbone-parse-es6-todos-improved

This repository contains several pre-packed downloads in the `dist/` directory. There are AMD, CJS, UMD and Global distributions that contain the backbone-parse-es6 and Parse libraries. The "global-inclusive" bundle includes the latest Parse (1.8.5), jQuery (2.2.3) and Underscore (1.8.3) libraries.
